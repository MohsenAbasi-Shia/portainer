## How to use
Portainer uses hash of admin password. So, you must give it. In order to generate hash of a custom password hash and then set it in file '.env', you should run initialize script file at the beggining:<br/>
        1. Change admin \<password\>:<br/>
                `PORTAINER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>`<br/>
        2. Run the initialize file:<br/>
                `/bin/sh ./init.sh`<br/>
        3. Run the container:<br/>
                `docker-compose up -d`<br/>

Note: A new password does not affect a running portainer. You can only set admin password at the first run of the container!
